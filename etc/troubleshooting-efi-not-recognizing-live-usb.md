# Troubleshooting EFI not recognizing live USB

Just writing this down here because I've spent too much time trying to figure this out, then forgot my solution, then find myself in the same situation a few months later.

Things to check:
* Make sure that Secure Boot is off.
* Try disabling then re-enabling USB Boot (weird, I know).
